## Bio 🍃
I am Swarnalee! 👋 I am currently an **Upstream Data Analyst** at [Blue Sky Analytics](https://blueskyhq.io/). Previously, I have spent some time as a **Project Staff** at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi with [Dr. CT Dhanya](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~dhanya/).

I have graduated with Bachelor of Technology in [Civil Engineering](http://ce.nits.ac.in/) from National Institute of Technology Silchar in 2021. My interests lie broadly in the fields of [climate change](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change), [water resources](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources), [climate resilience](https://www.c2es.org/content/climate-resilience-overview/), environmental statistics and computer programming.

I spend a good lot of time learning about environment, sustainability, climate change and computer programming on the web from [moocs](https://twitter.com/swarnaleem/status/1517228937608581120?s=20&t=XmtQQlXM3smrOe_PcGwCjw).

I am always open to interesting discussions 🌏 and collaborations ✍🏽. <a class="internal-link" href="mailto:swarnaleem@gmail.com"> Email</a> ✉️ is the best way to reach me!
