**Doing what I do best**—meticulously documenting everything.

Welcome to my garden! This is where I explore my (research) ideas and share them publicly so others can read and provide feedback to help me improve my thinking.

<section class="callout">
🍃 Digital gardens are a philosophy of sharing content. It’s similar to blogging, but instead of sharing isolated posts each time, you post unfinished ideas that you come back to, build on, connect, and eventually grow into more polished states. It emphasizes doing over getting done!
</section>

## Why?
Mostly for my own reference, but also I want to document everything I learn and explore.
